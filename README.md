# Getting Started with Create React App

This server uses a node.js backend.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the server on local port 3001. Server must be running for client to function correctly.

### `npm test`

Can be used to run future server test scripts (edit in package.json). Currently prints an error as there are no test scripts.

## Development

To develop and test the client, ensure that the server is running using `npm start` in the project root directory. Then do `cd client` and `npm start` to start the client. React will automatically reload the app when you save code changes.

To develop and test the server, you will have to manually restart with ctrl+C and `npm start`. Make sure you have saved your modified files if using VSCode.

## Deployment

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-react-app-with-a-node-backend-the-complete-guide/) to set up the project. It suggests an easy way to deploy the client and server to the web, but I think that is something we can leave for later.
